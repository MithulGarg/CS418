Intro:

MP2 - Flight Simulator:

We wrote a simple flight simulator using WebGL to handle display, with airplane automatically moving forward at a fixed speed.
The user will control the bank and tilt of the airplane through the arrow keys.

Pressing the left (right) arrow key will make the plane roll to its left (right).
Pressing the up (down) arrow key will cause the airplane to pitch up (down).
